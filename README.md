# slack-base16-tomorrow-dark
A dark theme based on the base16-tomorrow dark color palette and the Slack Night Mode style.

A flat dark color scheme based off the base16-tomorrow dark color palette. Someday I'll add some more coloration here, but splitting up the selectors will be a lot of work.

Thanks to Chris Kempson for the [base16 color palettes](http://chriskempson.github.io/base16/).

Big thanks to Jonathan la Cour for creating the original [Slack Night Mode](https://userstyles.org/styles/101971/slack-night-mode), off which this is functionally based (just the colors changed).

Best served with my other Slack style, [Monospace Font & Condenser for
Slack](https://userstyles.org/styles/108061/monospace-font-condenser-for-slack).
